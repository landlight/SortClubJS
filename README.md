# SortClubJS
Just Me Practising Sorting Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms
- Unit Tests
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort 
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort (--- Got lazy and copy code ---)
- Quick Sort (--- Got lazy and copy code ---)
- Random Quick Sort (Implemented using this pseudo code: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quicksort-using-random-pivoting/)


... seems like default sort by node.js seems a bit quicker 

For using the items: 

const { default: bubbleSort } = require("sort-club-js/dist/bubbleSort");

Use the sorting, you would like to choose -> only work for numbers and I am lazy to update the looks. Have fun.
