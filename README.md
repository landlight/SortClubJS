Just Me Practising Sorting Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms
- Unit Tests
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort 
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort (--- Got lazy and copy code ---)
- Quick Sort (--- Got lazy and copy code ---)
- Random Quick Sort (Implemented using this pseudo code: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quicksort-using-random-pivoting/)
